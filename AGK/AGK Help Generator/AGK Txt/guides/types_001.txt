What are types?

_text
Types provide a way to group data into a container. This is very useful as it allows you to keep your data organised. Let's consider a game where you want to keep track of a player's score, how many lives they have left and how many bullets they have remaining. This could be handled by declaring three separate variables.

_tier1
score as integer
lives as integer
bullets as integer
_tier1

_text
An alternative approach would be to group this data together using a type. Here's how it would look.

_tier1
type playerType
	score as integer
	lives as integer
	bullets as integer
endtype
_tier1

_text
The keyword <i>type</i> is used followed by a name, which is an identifier for the type. In this instance <i>playerType</i> has been used. The lines that follow declare variables that will be contained within this type. To finish the type declaration the keyword <i>endtype</i> is used.

_text
With the type declaration in place the next step is to declare a variable that uses this type. This is achieved by using the <i>as</i> keyword and works in the same way as declaring other variables, except we use the identifier name for the type instead of the typical float, integer or string.

_tier1
player as playerType
_tier1

_text
The variable declaration for <i>player</i> tells the program that it's going to be of type <i>playerType</i>, that has been declared earlier.

_text
To access the variables contained within the type the dot operator is used. The next few lines show values being assigned to the variables within the type.

_tier1
player.score = 100
player.lives = 3
player.bullets = 5
_tier1

_text
Here's a complete program that defines a type, declares a variable that uses the type, assigns values to the variable and then displays its values on screen.

_tier1
type playerType
	score as integer
	lives as integer
	bullets as integer
endtype
<br>
player as playerType
<br>
player.score = 100
player.lives = 3
player.bullets = 5
<br>
do
	print ( player.score )
	print ( player.lives )
	print ( player.bullets )
	<br>
	sync ( )
loop
_tier1
