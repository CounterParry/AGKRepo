Declaring variables

_text
Now that you have seen how to declare variables, it's time to create a small program that demonstrates all the variable types in action.

_tier1
currentScore as integer = 0
timeLeft as integer = 123
shipSpeed as float = 0.47
playerName as string = "player 1"
<br>
do
	print ( currentScore )
	print ( timeLeft )
	print ( shipSpeed )
	print ( playerName )
	sync ( )
loop
_tier1

_text
This program simply prints out the contents of the variables on screen.

Given that it's not necessary to explicitly declare integer variables our program could be modified to look like this.

_tier1
currentScore = 0
timeLeft = 123
shipSpeed as float = 0.47
playerName as string = "player 1"
<br>
do
	print ( currentScore )
	print ( timeLeft )
	print ( shipSpeed )
	print ( playerName )
	sync ( )
loop
_tier1

_text
Either approach is perfectly acceptable.
