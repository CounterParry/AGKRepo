Global and local precedence

_text
If a local variable is declared that has the same name as a global variable, then it will take precedence over the global variable. The program that follows declares a global named <i>value</i>, however, the function <i>myFunction</i> declares a local variable named <i>value</i> and gives it a floating point value. This variable has priority over the global.

_tier1
global value as integer = 1
<br>
do
	print ( value )
	myFunction ( )
	<br>
	sync ( )
loop
<br>
function myFunction ( )
	value as float = 1.2
	print ( value )
endfunction
_tier1

_text
When you run the program you will see 1 and 1.2 displayed on screen. Due to the local variable taking precedence within the function any attempt to work with <i>value</i> inside <i>myFunction</i> affects the local and not the global.
