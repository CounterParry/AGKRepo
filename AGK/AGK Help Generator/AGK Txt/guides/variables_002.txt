Variable data type

_text
By default AppGameKit Studio will treat the variable <i>score</i> as an integer. This means that the variable can only be used to store positive or negative whole numbers. The variable <i>score</i> could be assigned values such as 100, 0, -50 or 123.

_tier1
score = 100
score = 0
score = -50
score = 123

_text
There will come a time when your game requires different kinds of data, for example, you can't store the name of a player using an integer and it may be you want to control the speed of a ship with more precision, using a fractional number rather than an integer.

_text
The way that AppGameKit Studio handles this is to provide you with the option of declaring a variable and specifying its type. The three basic types of data storage available are.

_listbegin
integers
floats
strings
_listend
