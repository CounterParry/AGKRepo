Overview

_text
This guide provides an overview of loading and playing music in AppGameKit Studio.

_sheader
What formats are supported?

_text
AppGameKit Studio uses the OGG compressed music format as its main standard for loading and playing music files. The format is compressed, has a high quality and the decoding of the music is done on a separate thread to avoid any performance issues. It's easy to convert your music tracks to OGG format with the many different sound file converters.

How do I load music?

_text
The command <i>LoadMusicOGG</i> allows you to load a music track. Here are the available options:

_tier1
LoadMusicOGG ( id, file )
id = LoadMusicOGG ( file )
_tier1

_tier2
void LoadMusicOGG ( UINT id, uString file );
UINT LoadMusicOGG ( uString file );
_tier2

_text
A music file can be loaded by either assigning an ID number manually or having it provided to you automatically. The next step is to let AppGameKit Studio know which file you want to load e.g. "myMusic.ogg". Please note that ID numbers are unique for a command set. Therefore it's feasible to have a music track loaded with an ID number of 1 and a sprite with an ID of 1. Music resources are limited, so only ID numbers betwen 0 - 50 are valid.

_text
Here's one approach to loading a music track. The command <i>LoadMusicOGG</i> is called, an ID number of 1 is specified and the file to load is "myMusic.ogg":

_tier1
LoadMusicOGG ( 1, "myMusic.ogg" )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadMusicOGG ( 1, "myMusic.ogg" );
_tier2

_text 
This alternative method demonstrates how a music track can be loaded with an automatically assigned ID number:

_tier1
sound = LoadMusicOGG ( "myMusic.ogg" )
_tier1

_tier2
sound = agk::LoadMusicOGG ( "myMusic.ogg" );
_tier2

How can I play music?

_text
Once music has been loaded it can be played with the <i>PlayMusic</i> command. Several variants of this command exist:

_tier1
PlayMusicOGG ( id )
PlayMusicOGG ( id, loop )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::PlayMusicOGG ( UINT id, int loop = 1 );
_tier2

_text
The parameters for this command are as follows:

_listbegin
ID
loop

_listend

_text
The ID number refers to the ID of the music you want to play. The loop parameter controls whether the music will be looped. When this value is set to 0 the music track will play through once and then stop. When this value is set to 1 the playback will continually loop.

_text
This example shows how to load and play music that will loop:

_tier1
LoadMusicOGG ( 1, "myMusic.ogg" )
PlayMusicOGG ( 1, 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadMusicOGG ( 1, "myMusic.ogg" );
agk::PlayMusicOGG ( 1, 1 );
_tier2

How do I stop music from playing?

_text
To stop all music from playing call the <i>StopMusic</i> command. This command has no parameters. The following code loads music into ID 1, plays it with looping turned on and then stops the playback:

_tier1
LoadMusicOGG ( 1, "myMusic.ogg" )
PlayMusicOGG ( 1, 1 )
StopMusicOGG ( )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadMusicOGG ( 1, "myMusic.ogg" );
agk::PlayMusicOGG ( 1, 1 );
agk::StopMusicOGG ( );
_tier2

How do I delete music?

_text
It may be necessary to delete previously loaded music and free up available memory. To delete music call the command <i>DeleteMusic</i>:

_tier1
DeleteMusicOGG ( id )
_tier1

_tier2
void DeleteMusicOGG ( UINT id );
_tier2

_text
This command only requires the ID number of the music you want to delete.

_text
Here's an example of loading music and then deleting it:

_tier1
LoadMusicOGG ( 1, "myMusic.ogg" )
DeleteMusicOGG ( 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadMusicOGG ( 1, "myMusic.ogg" );
agk::DeleteMusicOGG ( 1 );
_tier2
