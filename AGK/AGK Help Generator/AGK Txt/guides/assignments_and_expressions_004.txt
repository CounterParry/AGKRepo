Expression order

_text
The order in which the expression is calculated is determined by the operator precedence. 

_listbegin
Brackets e.g. ( and )
Exponents e.g. 2 ^ 2
Division e.g. 4 / 2
Multiplication e.g. 4 * 2
Addition e.g. 4 + 2
Subtraction e.g. 4 - 2

_text
This example demonstrates the operator precedence taking affect in two expressions.

_tier1
valueA as integer = 0
valueB as integer = 0
<br>
valueA = 2 + 10 / 2
valueB = ( 2 + 10 ) / 2
<br>
do
	print ( valueA )
	print ( valueB )
	<br>
	sync ( )
loop
_tier1

_text
In the case of <i>valueA</i> the expression being assigned to it has the division calculated first, so 10 / 2 = 5, which is then added to 2 and assigned to <i>valueA</i>. Therefore this variable has a value of 7.

_text
<i>valueB</i> has used brackets to force the addition to be calculated first. In this instance the result of 2 + 10 = 12 is divided by 2 giving the variable a value of 6.
