Integers

_text
This is the default variable type in AppGameKit Studio and as mentioned earlier can be used to store positive or negative whole numbers. Here's the kind of data an integer variable may hold.

_listbegin
Current score in the game
Which level the player is on
How many lives the player has left
The number of enemies in a game
A countdown timer controlling how much time is left to complete the level
_listend

_text
Variables to store this data could be declared as follows -

_tier1
currentScore = 0
currentLevel = 0
lives = 0
enemiesRemaining = 0
timeLeft = 0
_tier1

_text
The name of the variables is entirely your choice. You can use whatever name you want, as long as it doesn't clash with existing commands. You can't have a variable named <i>print</i> as this will conflict with the command called <i>print</i>. The names don't have to be descriptive as shown in the above list. They could be renamed like this.

_tier1
s = 0
cl = 0
l = 0
e = 0
t = 0
_tier1

_text
Although that is perfectly valid it's certainly not so clear as in the first attempt at declaring them. When dealing with variables it's a good idea to name them in a descriptive way where possible. Having a variable named <i>enemiesRemaining</i> should make it pretty obvious what kind of data it holds, whereas a variable called <i>e</i> could be just about anything.

_text
You can be more explicit when it comes to declaring variables by specifying the type in the declaration. All of the integer variables can also be declared like this.

_tier1
currentScore as integer = 0
currentLevel as integer = 0
lives as integer = 0
enemiesRemaining as integer = 0
timeLeft as integer = 0
_tier1

_text
It is not necessary to give the variable a value when declaring it when using the keywords <i>as integer</i>, in which case it will automatically default to 0. All of these declarations are acceptable.

_tier1
currentScore as integer = 0
currentLevel as integer = 50
lives as integer
enemiesRemaining as integer
timeLeft = 123
_tier1

_text
Bear in mind when you declare a variable without specifying its type then you must give it a default value, as shown in the above listing where <i>timeLeft</i> is declared and given a value of 123.
