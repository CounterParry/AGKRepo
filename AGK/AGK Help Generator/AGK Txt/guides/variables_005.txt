Strings

_text
The final basic data type are strings. This kind of variable can be used to store characters and words. Some examples might include storing the name of a player, a description for the level that you're playing and instructions on how to play the game.

_text
Just like with floats when dealing with strings you will need to explicitly declare the variable, although you don't need to specify a default value. If you choose not to assign your variable a value it will default to a blank string.

_tier1
playerName as string = "player 1"
levelDescription as string
levelInstruction as string
_tier1

_text
In this instance <i>playerName</i> has been declared as a string and been assigned the string "player 1". The other two variables are empty strings that can be filled in later on.
