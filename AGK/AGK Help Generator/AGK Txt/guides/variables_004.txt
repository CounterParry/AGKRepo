Floats

Floating point values can be used when you need more precision for your data. If you had a ship flying across the screen and stored that data in an integer variable you are limited to whole numbers, so the ship might have a speed of 10. With a floating point variable you can use fractional numbers, meaning a speed of 10.5 would work. Floating point variables can also hold whole numbers. Here's some examples of values that could be used.

_listbegin
20.56
99.9125
250
-455.244
_listend

_text
Unlike integer values when you want to use floating point data you must explicitly declare the variable, but like with an integer it's not essential to provide a default value. If you don't give your variable a value it will default to 0.0.
