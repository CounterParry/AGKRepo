Assigning values to variables

_text
The value of a variable can be assigned to another variable after it has been declared, as shown in this example.

_tier1
defaultPlayerLives as integer = 10
playerLives as integer = 0
playerScore as integer = 0
<br>
playerLives = defaultPlayerLives
<br>
do
	print ( defaultPlayerLives )
	print ( playerLives )
	print ( playerScore )
	<br>
	sync ( )
loop
_tier1

_text
The first three lines declare and assign default values to the variables. The next line takes the value of <i>defaultPlayerLives</i> and assigns it to the variable <i>playerLives</i>.

_tier1
playerLives = defaultPlayerLives
_tier1

_text
Which means at this point <i>playerLives</i> has been assigned a value of 10. When you run the program you will see 10, 10 and 0 displayed on screen.
